OpenTagViewer

Apparently, this is the first Android App to allow you to view/track your **official Apple AirTags**, because I couldn't find any app or webpage that lets me do this.

This project is a relatively polished looking Android/Java UI-wrapper around the Python [FindMy.py](https://github.com/malmeloo/FindMy.py) library, which is a derivative of the [openhaystack](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack) project.

(The Android app still calls the Python library under the hood)

(No, the location history isn't real)

## Features ‚≠ê

- View current "live" location of your AirTags **on Android**
- Track & save historical location history of your AirTags (a feature notably missing from the iOS FindMy apps!)
- UI customisation options:
    - `‚òÄÔ∏è Light mode` / `üåë Dark mode`
    - _Some_ üåê Language Support


## How To Use üìñ

### Requirements ü§ì

1. An Android phone with the `OpenTagViewer` app installed
2. A (free) [Apple Account](https://account.apple.com/) with 2FA enabled to be via either `SMS` or `Trusted Device`
3. One or more **AirTags**, which need to be already registered to some Apple account via the `FindMy` app and shared with your account
4. A Mac or a [MacOS Virtual Machine](https://github.com/parawanderer/OpenTagViewer/wiki/How-To:-Manually-Export-AirTags#prerequisites) of MacOS version `Sonoma (14)` or lower (only needed once/initially)

### How to view my AirTag on my Android Phone?!

See [üìñ wiki](https://github.com/parawanderer/OpenTagViewer/wiki) for more details:

1. Install the app and log in to your Apple Account
2. Create an export `.zip` file by following [this wiki guide](https://github.com/parawanderer/OpenTagViewer/wiki/How-To:-Export-AirTags-From-Mac#opentagviewer-macos-export-app--recommended)
3. Import the `.zip` file in the app
4. Profit: you can now track your AirTags on your Android Phone indefinitely!

## Contributing

Contributions/MRs are more than welcome.

Plenty of things can be improved in this project as it was mostly a "hackathony" thing I tried to throw together ASAP and make presentable for layusers.
Plenty of best practices haven't been followed, e.g. in the Testing & CI/CD setup.

**I think it would be nice if the app could support the following features:**

- **\[üêõ BLOCKED due to [Bug](https://github.com/malmeloo/FindMy.py/issues/118)]** Locate Nearby AirTags using Low-Power Bluetooth & display the latest update in that case
- **\[üôè BLOCKED by [Feature Request](https://github.com/malmeloo/FindMy.py/issues/88)]** "Ring"/"Make Noise" button
- Support showing unofficial "AirTags" created using [openhaystack](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack)
- Integrate with projects that query **Google**'s/**Samsung**'s network and also show these in the same UI:
   - see [thread](https://github.com/malmeloo/FindMy.py/discussions/30), [thread](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/discussions/210) and repo [GoogleFindMyTools](https://github.com/leonboe1/GoogleFindMyTools)
   - TL;DR: I think this (these two?) are separate projects with their own repos.
- If you'd like to contribute a Language or make corrections in my Translations, feel free to do that too
    - Current list of languages can be found back [here](./app/src/main/res/xml/locales_config.xml)
    - Translation files can be found back at paths like [`./app/src/main/res/values-en/strings.xml`](./app/src/main/res/values-en/strings.xml) (replace `values-en` with `values-<your locale>`)
