# üßô OpenTagViewer MacOS AirTag Export Wizard

A very simple GUI-based utility that allows users to select which AirTags to export `.plist` files for,
to be able to then import them in the OpenTagViewer Android App.

The wizard will generally show you the most recent names for your devices.
These names (and emojis) can be set using the [FindMy app on MacOS or iOS devices](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iphf666e9559/ios#aria-iphe5212d100).

The UI is pretty plain looking, but ideally this tool only needs to be used once/rarely! üòÄ

## üîß Python Utility Scripts

> [!WARNING]  
> It is possible that these scripts will not execute on all python3 versions!
> 
> However, the [OpentagViewer Wizard App](https://github.com/parawanderer/OpenTagViewer/releases?q=macos-exporter&expanded=true) that can be downloaded from the `Releases` page will work regardless of the Python version you have installed on your MacOS machine, as it uses its own bundled/embedded version of Python that it gets packaged with.


## airtag_decryptor.py

This is an implementation based on [airtag-decryptor.swift](https://gist.github.com/airy10/5205dc851fbd0715fcd7a5cdde25e7c8)
by [airty10](https://gist.github.com/airy10), which was based on [airtag-decryptor.swift by Matus](https://gist.github.com/YeapGuy/f473de53c2a4e8978bc63217359ca1e4),
but in python.

Reasoning for this: I don't know Swift (and I don't even use MacOS) and I need to copy the logic into an UI app for MacOS for my android OpenTagViewer app.

### How to use:

- You need [python3 and pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/). (You may use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or IDE integration to set up your Python version as `>= 3.13.x` too)
- Clone the repo and `cd` into this directory
- Install requirements:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- **(OPTIONAL)** Change your output path on [airtag_decryptor.py:30](https://github.com/parawanderer/OpenTagViewer/blob/main/python/airtag_decryptor.py#L30) if wanted
    - Default output path: `~/plist_decrypt_output`
- Run the script:
    ```bash
    python airtag_decryptor.py
    ```
    - Note that it will prompt your password twice.
- The script will open the specified output folder on success



## üßë‚Äçüíª Export Wizard Development

### (Dev) Run it as a python script on MacOS

You need `python` and `tkinter` installed (here, tkinter is what provides the GUI functionality):
```shell
brew install python3
brew install python-tk

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then:
```shell
python wizard.py
```

### Build Icons (on MacOS)

```shell
./make_icon.sh
```


### Build executable (on MacOS)

You will need to install `pyinstaller`:

```shell
pip install pyinstaller
```

Then you can build a distribution for the app:

```shell
pyinstaller \
    --onefile \
    --windowed \
    --name "OpenTagViewer" \
    --osx-bundle-identifier "dev.wander.opentagviewer" \
    --icon=OpenTagViewer.icns \
    wizard.py
```
